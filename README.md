This is the collection of exercises from the course Simulation Of Complex Systems (FIM750) at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.
The course is a part of the Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) program. 

Purpose:
Much of modelling in the sciences focuses on simple models, highlighting key mechanisms using small sets of moving parts. However, in complex systems interesting features are often a direct result of having large sets of interacting particles or agents with different characteristics. This makes new tools a necessity. This course introduces simulation techniques frequently used in complex systems to handle models with many heterogeneous parts. Specifically, we will look at agent-based modelling, evolutionary game theory, cellular automata, and networks, with application to physics, biology and social sciences. We will also learn how to validate the outcomes of simulation models in order to reach scientifically sound conclusions.
